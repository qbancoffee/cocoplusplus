# CoCo++
I spent some time transcribing the CoCo 3 schematic into KiCAD to contribute to the bit preserve project.
Using that schematic, I created a drop in replacement board which I subsequently ordered, assembled, and tested.
At this point I consider that project done and time to move on. If you are interested in the bit preserve
project here is the link.<br>

So now it's time to have fun....<br>
I want to base this board on the CoCo 3 for several reasons.

- It's the latest real CoCo.
- I never used one in my youth.
- When people upgrade to to the GIME-X, they may want to use their otherwise unused GIME
- If used with a GIME-X then there would be a new CoCo added to the world. 

To start this I stripped the CoCo 3 portion out of the bit-preserve project and
created this repository so that I could make changes to the board that I would like to see. I'm making
this available so that anyone can contribute ideas and expertise.

### Goals
I still don't know what all of the goals are but I'll list some ideas that I've had or that others have mentioned or recommended.
- Having fun
- Mod for potential DMA
- USB keyboard
- A different form factor
- HDMI out
- Surface mount components
